abstract = {Modern optimizing compilers use several passes over a program's intermediate representation to generate good code. Many of these optimizations exhibit a phase-ordering problem. Getting the best code may require iterating optimizations until a fixed point is reached. Combining these phases can lead to the discovery of more facts about the program, exposing more opportunities for optimization. This article presents a framework for describing optimizations. It shows how to combine two such frameworks and how to reason about the properties of the resulting framework. The structure of the frame work provides insight into when a combination yields better results. To make the ideas more concrete, this article presents a framework for combining constant propagation, value numbering, and unreachable-code elimination. It is an open question as to what other frameworks can be combined in this way.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for performing global value numbering on a routine in static single assignment form. Our algorithm has all the strengths of the most powerful existing practical methods of global value numbering; it unifies optimistic value numbering with constant folding, algebraic simplification and unreachable code elimination. It goes beyond existing methods by unifying optimistic value numbering with further analyses: it canonicalizes the structure of expressions in order to expose more congruences by performing global reassociation, it exploits the congruences induced by the predicates of conditional jumps (predicate inference and value inference), and it associates the arguments of acyclic \o{} functions with the predicates controlling their arrival (\o{} predication), thus enabling congruence finding on conditional control structures. Finally, it implements an efficient sparse formulation and offers a range of tradeoffs between compilation time and optimization strength. We describe an implementation of the algorithm and present measurements of its strength and efficiency collected when optimizing the SPEC CINT2000 C benchmarks.},

These functions are defined as compositions of simple primitives (as is common in functional programming), with internal data representations that are learned rather than manually designed.
